title: Traces Panel
description: Grouped operation traces for timeline analysis.
---

The Traces panel groups related events into complete operation traces, making it easier to analyze the timeline of individual operations. While the Events panel shows every event chronologically, the Traces panel shows each operation as a cohesive unit.

## How traces work

Each operation (ingest, retrieve, rerank, delete) is assigned an operation ID when it starts. The Traces panel groups all events with the same operation ID into a single trace, showing you:

- **Start time** — When the operation began
- **End time** — When it completed (or errored)
- **Total duration** — End-to-end time
- **Phase breakdown** — Time spent in each phase of the operation

## Reading a trace

When you select a trace, you see its timeline of events:

```
ingest:start         ──────┐ 0ms
ingest:chunking      ──────┼─── 12ms
ingest:embedding:start ────┼─── 15ms
ingest:embedding:batch ────┼─── 45ms
ingest:embedding:batch ────┼─── 78ms
ingest:embedding:complete ─┼─── 92ms
ingest:storage:complete ───┼─── 120ms
ingest:complete      ──────┘ 125ms
```

The visualization shows how much time each phase took relative to the total operation time. Long gaps between events indicate slow phases.

## Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` or `↓` | Move to next trace |
| `k` or `↑` | Move to previous trace |
| `Enter` | Expand/collapse trace details |

## Identifying bottlenecks

The Traces panel is particularly useful for identifying which phase of an operation is slowest:

**Embedding-bound operations** — If most of the trace time is between `embedding:start` and `embedding:complete`, your embedding model or provider is the bottleneck. Consider batching, caching, or switching to a faster model.

**Storage-bound operations** — If `storage:complete` takes a long time after embedding finishes, database writes are slow. Check your Postgres connection, indexes, and connection pool settings.

**Chunking-bound operations** — If `chunking:complete` takes a long time, your chunking logic might be inefficient for the content type.

## Comparing traces

With multiple traces visible, you can compare durations across operations:

- Operations on different documents — Are some document types slower than others?
- Operations at different times — Is there a pattern (e.g., slower under load)?
- Before and after changes — Did your optimization actually help?
