description: At-a-glance operation metrics and activity overview.
---

The Dashboard is the default view when you connect to the debug server. It provides a high-level overview of your RAG pipeline's activity, making it easy to spot patterns and anomalies at a glance.

## What the dashboard shows

The Dashboard organizes information into three sections:

### Operations summary

The top row displays aggregate metrics for each operation type:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **INGEST** | Total ingestions, last operation time, average time |
| **RETRIEVE** | Total retrievals, last operation time, average time |
| **RERANK** | Total rerank calls, last operation time, average time |
| **DELETE** | Total deletions, last operation time, average time |

Each metric card shows:
- **Count** — How many operations of this type have occurred in the session
- **Last** — Duration of the most recent operation (in milliseconds)
- **Avg** — Rolling average duration (based on the last 10 operations)

If any errors have occurred, an error count appears at the end of the row, highlighted in red.

### Latency sparkline

Below the metrics, a sparkline chart visualizes the latency of your last 30 operations. This makes it easy to spot:

- **Latency spikes** — Sudden increases that might indicate a problem
- **Trending changes** — Gradual increases or decreases over time
- **Outliers** — Individual operations that took much longer than typical

The sparkline includes all operation types (ingest, retrieve, rerank, delete) on a single timeline, giving you a unified view of system responsiveness.

### Recent events

The bottom section shows the 10 most recent events in reverse chronological order (newest first). Each event row displays:

- **Timestamp** — When the event occurred
- **Type** — The event type (e.g., `ingest:complete`, `retrieve:start`)
- **Summary** — Key information like duration or chunk count

This gives you a quick sense of what's happening without switching to the full Events panel.

## Reading the dashboard

The Dashboard is designed for pattern recognition rather than detailed analysis. Use it to answer questions like:

**"Is my pipeline healthy?"** — Stable latencies, no errors, and reasonable operation counts indicate a healthy system.

**"What's the typical performance?"** — The average times give you a baseline. If these seem high, something might need optimization.

**"Are there any problems?"** — Error counts, latency spikes in the sparkline, or error events in the recent list all signal issues needing attention.

**"How active is the system?"** — Operation counts show the volume of work. Unusually high or low counts might indicate unexpected behavior.

## Navigation

The Dashboard is Tab 1. You can reach it by:
- Pressing `1` from any panel
- Using `Shift+Tab` to cycle between panels

The Dashboard has no interactive elements—it's a read-only overview. To take action, navigate to the relevant specialized panel:

- See an error? Check the Events panel (`2`) for details
- Want to investigate slow operations? Use the Traces panel (`3`)
- Need to run a test query? Switch to the Query panel (`4`)
