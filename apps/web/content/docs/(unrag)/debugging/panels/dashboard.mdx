description: At-a-glance operation metrics and activity overview.

The Dashboard is what you see first when you connect to the debug server. Think of it as the control room view—you're not here to take action, you're here to understand what's happening at a glance.

## What you're looking at

The top row shows four metric cards, one for each operation type: ingest, retrieve, rerank, and delete. Each card tells you how many times that operation has run, how long the most recent one took, and what the average duration has been over the last ten runs. If any errors have occurred, you'll see a red error count at the end of the row.

Below the metrics, there's a sparkline chart that visualizes latency over time. It shows the last thirty operations, giving you a quick sense of whether things are stable or if something changed recently. A sudden spike jumps out immediately. A gradual upward trend suggests something might be degrading. Consistent flat lines mean the system is behaving predictably.

At the bottom, you'll find the ten most recent events in reverse chronological order. This gives you a quick pulse check without needing to switch to the full Events panel. You can see what just happened, whether it succeeded, and how long it took.

## Reading the room

The Dashboard is designed for pattern recognition rather than deep investigation. When you glance at it, you're asking questions like: Is my pipeline healthy? What's the typical latency? Are there any obvious problems?

Stable latencies, no errors, and reasonable operation counts indicate a healthy system. If the average times seem high, something might need optimization. Error counts or spikes in the sparkline signal issues that need attention. Unusually high or low operation counts might indicate unexpected application behavior.

The Dashboard has no interactive elements—it's purely observational. When you spot something interesting, that's your cue to switch to a more specialized panel. Seeing errors? Head to the Events panel to get the details. Want to understand why a particular operation was slow? The Traces panel can break it down for you.

You can reach the Dashboard at any time by pressing `1`, or cycle through tabs with `Shift+Tab`.
