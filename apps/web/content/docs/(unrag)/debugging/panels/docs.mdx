description: Document inspection and management for exploring your vector store.
---

The Docs panel lets you browse stored documents, inspect their chunks, and manage content directly. This is essential for understanding how your content is structured in the vector store and for removing problematic documents during development.

## Setup requirements

The Docs panel requires both the engine and store inspector to be registered:

```ts
import { registerUnragDebug } from "@unrag/debug";

registerUnragDebug({
  engine,
  storeInspector: engine.storeInspector,
});
```

The `storeInspector` provides methods for listing documents and retrieving chunk details. It's available from your engine instance if your store adapter supports it. Without it, the panel displays a warning about missing docs capability.

## Panel layout

The Docs panel has three main areas:

### Store stats bar

At the top, a summary shows:
- **adapter** — Which store adapter is in use (drizzle, prisma, etc.)
- **vectors** — Total vector count in the store
- **dim** — Embedding dimension
- **table row counts** — Rows in each relevant table

### Document list (left)

Lists all documents matching your current filter:
- **Source ID** — The document identifier
- **Chunk count** — How many chunks the document has
- **Created at** — When the document was ingested (if available)

### Document details (right)

Shows the selected document's chunks:
- **Token histogram** — Visual distribution of chunk sizes
- **Chunk list** — Each chunk with sequence number and token count
- **Selected chunk content** — Full text of the highlighted chunk

## Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Switch focus between documents and chunks |
| `j` or `↓` | Move selection down |
| `k` or `↑` | Move selection up |
| `[` | Previous page of documents |
| `]` | Next page of documents |
| `f` | Edit the prefix filter |
| `r` | Refresh document list and stats |
| `d` | Delete selected document (with confirmation) |
| `x` | Delete selected chunk (with confirmation) |
| `PageUp`/`Ctrl+U` | Scroll chunk content up |
| `PageDown`/`Ctrl+D` | Scroll chunk content down |

## Filtering by prefix

Use the prefix filter to narrow down documents:

1. Press `f` to enter filter edit mode
2. Type a prefix (e.g., `docs:` or `user:123:`)
3. Press `Enter` to apply

This is useful when you have many documents with a naming convention. For example, filter to `notion:` to see only Notion-synced documents.

## Inspecting chunks

When you select a document, the details panel updates to show its structure:

**Token histogram** — Shows the distribution of chunk sizes (in approximate tokens). A wide distribution suggests inconsistent chunking. Very small chunks might lack context; very large ones might dilute relevance.

**Chunk list** — Each chunk shows:
- **Sequence number** — Order within the document
- **Token count** — Approximate size
- **Content preview** — First part of the chunk text

**Selected chunk** — The full content of the highlighted chunk, scrollable. Check that chunks contain complete thoughts and don't cut off mid-sentence.

## Deleting content

During development, you may need to remove documents:

**Delete a document:** Select the document and press `d`. Confirm with `y` (or cancel with `n`/`Escape`). This removes the document and all its chunks.

**Delete a specific chunk:** Tab to the chunks panel, select a chunk, and press `x`. Confirm with `y`. This is useful for surgically removing problematic chunks without deleting the entire document.

<Callout>
Deletion is permanent. The debug panel doesn't have undo. Use with care, especially if connected to a shared or production-like environment.
</Callout>

## Missing content warning

If your store adapter is configured with `storeChunkContent: false`, the Docs panel shows a warning:

> Chunks have no stored `content`. Your store adapter may not persist text content.

In this configuration, only embeddings are stored, not the original text. The chunk list will show empty content. To use the Docs panel's inspection features, enable `storeChunkContent` in your engine configuration.
