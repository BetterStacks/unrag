description: Choosing an embedding model and understanding the tradeoffs.

The embedding model you choose affects retrieval quality, latency, and cost. There's no universally best model—the right choice depends on your content, query patterns, and budget. Here's how to think about the decision.

<Callout>
This page covers the conceptual considerations for choosing a model. For setup instructions for specific providers, see [Providers](/docs/providers).
</Callout>

## The key tradeoffs

**Dimensions vs. performance**: Higher-dimensional embeddings capture more nuance but require more storage and slightly slower similarity calculations. OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small produces 1536-dimensional vectors; text-embedding-3-large produces 3072 dimensions. For most use cases, the quality difference doesn't justify doubling your storage.

**Quality vs. cost**: Better models cost more per embedding. If you're embedding millions of documents, the cost difference between models adds up. Start with a cheaper model and upgrade only if retrieval quality demonstrably suffers.

**Latency**: All cloud embedding APIs have similar latency (100-300ms per call), but some models process tokens faster than others. For real-time applications, the embedding call is usually your bottleneck.

## Recommended starting points

<Tabs items={['General Purpose', 'High Quality / Multilingual', 'Local / Private']}>
<Tab value="General Purpose">

For documentation, articles, and support content:

```ts
export const unrag = defineUnragConfig({
  // ...
  embedding: {
    provider: "openai",
    config: {
      model: "text-embedding-3-small",
      timeoutMs: 15_000,
    },
  },
} as const);
```

This model is fast, cheap, and produces good results for most English text. It's the default for a reason.

</Tab>
<Tab value="High Quality / Multilingual">

When quality is paramount or you have multilingual content:

```ts
export const unrag = defineUnragConfig({
  // ...
  embedding: {
    provider: "cohere",
    config: {
      model: "embed-multilingual-v3.0",
      timeoutMs: 20_000,
    },
  },
} as const);
```

Cohere's multilingual model handles multiple languages well and is optimized for retrieval tasks.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Local / Private">

For cost control or privacy requirements, use Ollama:

```ts
export const unrag = defineUnragConfig({
  // ...
  embedding: {
    provider: "ollama",
    config: {
      model: "nomic-embed-text",
      timeoutMs: 30_000,
    },
  },
} as const);
```

Eliminates API costs, reduces latency, and keeps data private. See [Ollama Provider](/docs/providers/ollama) for setup instructions.

## Keeping embeddings consistent

<Callout type="error" title="Critical">
All vectors in your database must come from the same embedding model. You cannot mix embeddings from different models and expect similarity search to work correctly.
</Callout>

Different models produce vectors in different semantic spaces. A query embedded with model A cannot meaningfully compare to chunks embedded with model B. The math produces numbers, but those numbers are meaningless.

This means:

1. **Pick a model and stick with it.** Don't change models on a whim.

2. **If you change models, re-embed everything.** There's no shortcut. Delete your existing embeddings and regenerate them with the new model.

3. **Store which model was used.** Unrag records `embedding_dimension` in the database, and the `embeddingModel` field in responses tells you which model was active.

## Detecting model changes

Unrag tracks the embedding model name in every response:

```ts
const result = await engine.ingest({ sourceId: "doc-1", content: "..." });
console.log(result.embeddingModel);
// "openai:text-embedding-3-small"

const retrieved = await engine.retrieve({ query: "test" });
console.log(retrieved.embeddingModel);
// Should match!
```

If you're switching models, verify that your retrieval is using the same model that was used for ingestion. A mismatch produces results, but they'll be essentially random rather than semantically meaningful.

## Re-embedding after model changes

When you decide to switch models, the safest approach is:

1. **Deploy the new model to your config** but don't use it yet
2. **Run a re-ingestion job** that processes all your content with the new model
3. **Verify retrieval quality** with test queries
4. **Delete old embeddings** if you're confident the new ones are correct

```ts
// Re-ingestion script
async function reembed() {
  const engine = createUnragEngine(); // Now using new model
  
  // Fetch all documents from your database
  const docs = await fetchAllDocuments();
  
  for (const doc of docs) {
    await engine.ingest({
      sourceId: doc.sourceId,
      content: doc.content,
      metadata: doc.metadata,
    });
    console.log(`Re-embedded: ${doc.sourceId}`);
  }
}
```

For large datasets, batch this work and track progress. Re-embedding 100,000 documents takes hours and costs money—plan accordingly.

## Evaluating retrieval quality

How do you know if a model change improved things? You need test queries with expected results:

```ts
const testCases = [
  { query: "how do I reset my password?", expectedSourceId: "docs:auth" },
  { query: "pricing for enterprise", expectedSourceId: "docs:pricing" },
  // ... more cases
];

for (const { query, expectedSourceId } of testCases) {
  const result = await engine.retrieve({ query, topK: 5 });
  const found = result.chunks.some((c) => c.sourceId.includes(expectedSourceId));
  console.log(`${query}: ${found ? "PASS" : "FAIL"}`);
}
```

Build a set of representative queries and track whether the expected documents appear in results. Run this before and after model changes to quantify the impact.

## Dimension truncation

Some embedding models support dimension truncation—you can request fewer dimensions to save space while retaining most of the semantic information. OpenAI's text-embedding-3 models support this through the `dimensions` config option:

```ts
embedding: {
  provider: "openai",
  config: {
    model: "text-embedding-3-small",
    dimensions: 512,  // Truncate from 1536 to 512
  },
},
```

Truncation can reduce storage by 60-70% with a modest quality tradeoff. If you use dimension truncation, make sure your database column is sized appropriately and that you're consistent—all vectors in your store should have the same dimensionality.

## Local embedding models

For cost control or privacy requirements, consider running embedding models locally with Ollama. Models like `nomic-embed-text` run on modest hardware and produce reasonable results:

```ts
embedding: {
  provider: "ollama",
  config: {
    model: "nomic-embed-text",
  },
},
```

Local models eliminate API costs entirely, reduce latency (no network round-trip), and keep your data private. The quality may be lower than cloud models for some use cases, but it's often sufficient. See [Ollama Provider](/docs/providers/ollama) for details.

## Multimodal embedding models

When your content includes images that carry semantic meaning (diagrams, charts, screenshots), consider a multimodal embedding model. These models embed both text and images into the same vector space, allowing text queries to match image content directly.

Currently, [Voyage](/docs/providers/voyage) is the only built-in provider with multimodal support:

```ts
embedding: {
  provider: "voyage",
  config: {
    type: "multimodal",
    model: "voyage-multimodal-3",
  },
},
```

<Callout>
Multimodal models must embed both text and images into the **same** semantic space. You cannot mix a text-only model for documents with a separate vision model for images—the embeddings wouldn't be comparable.
</Callout>

### When to use multimodal

Use multimodal when:
- Your content has diagrams, charts, or photos that carry information
- You want "show me the architecture diagram" to find actual diagrams
- Image captions aren't detailed enough for text-only search

Stick with text-only when:
- Your content is primarily text
- Images are decorative (logos, memes)
- You want to minimize embedding costs

### Fallback behavior

If you use a text-only embedding provider but your ingest includes images, Unrag falls back to embedding image captions. This works well when images have descriptive alt text or captions. See [Multimodal Embeddings](/docs/embedding/multimodal-embeddings) for details.
