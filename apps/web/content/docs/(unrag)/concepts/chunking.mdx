title: Chunking
description: How documents are split into chunks and why it matters for retrieval quality.
---

Chunking is how Unrag splits your documents into smaller pieces before embedding them. The quality of your retrieval depends significantly on how well your chunking strategy matches your content type.

## Why chunk?

Embedding models have context limits, and longer texts produce less useful embeddings. A 5,000-word document embedded as a single vector captures the overall topic but loses the nuance of individual sections.

Chunking breaks documents into pieces small enough that each embedding captures specific, queryable meaning. When someone searches for "how to configure authentication," you want to return the paragraph about authentication—not an entire document that mentions it once.

## Default behavior

Unrag uses **token-based recursive chunking** by default with these settings:

- **chunkSize**: 512 tokens
- **chunkOverlap**: 50 tokens
- **minChunkSize**: 24 tokens

The recursive chunker splits at natural boundaries (paragraphs → sentences → clauses → words) while respecting token limits.

## Available chunking methods

| Method | Best for | Install |
|--------|----------|---------|
| [Recursive](/docs/chunking/recursive) | General text | Built-in (default) |
| [Semantic](/docs/chunking/semantic) | LLM-guided boundaries | `bunx unrag add chunker:semantic` |
| [Markdown](/docs/chunking/markdown) | Documentation | `bunx unrag add chunker:markdown` |
| [Code](/docs/chunking/code) | Source code | `bunx unrag add chunker:code` |
| [Hierarchical](/docs/chunking/hierarchical) | Structured docs | `bunx unrag add chunker:hierarchical` |
| [Agentic](/docs/chunking/agentic) | High-value content | `bunx unrag add chunker:agentic` |
| [Custom](/docs/chunking/custom) | Your own logic | Bring your own |

## Quick configuration

```ts
export default defineUnragConfig({
  chunking: {
    method: "markdown",  // or "recursive", "semantic", etc.
    options: {
      chunkSize: 512,
      chunkOverlap: 50,
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```
