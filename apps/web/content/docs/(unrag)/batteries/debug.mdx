description: Real-time debugging TUI for RAG operations.

<Callout>
The Debug Panel provides a terminal-based interface for real-time visibility into your RAG pipeline—watching operations as they happen, running interactive queries, inspecting stored documents, and diagnosing configuration issues.
</Callout>

The debug battery adds two components to your Unrag installation:

**A WebSocket debug server** that runs alongside your application when `UNRAG_DEBUG=true` is set. The server broadcasts debug events and accepts interactive commands without affecting your application's normal operation.

**A terminal UI (TUI)** that you launch with `bunx unrag debug`. The TUI connects to the debug server and provides eight specialized panels for different debugging tasks.

## Installing the debug battery

```bash
bunx unrag@latest add battery debug
```

This installs the debug module into your project and adds the necessary dependencies.

## Quick setup

1. Set `UNRAG_DEBUG=true` in your environment
2. Register your engine in your app:

```ts
import { registerUnragDebug } from "@unrag/debug";

const engine = createUnragEngine();
registerUnragDebug({ engine, storeInspector: engine.storeInspector });
```

3. Start your app, then connect the TUI:

```bash
bunx unrag debug
```
