title: Prisma (Postgres + pgvector)
description: Use Prisma while keeping vector search in SQL.
---

The Prisma adapter uses `prisma.$executeRaw` and `prisma.$queryRaw`, so you can keep Prisma models minimal and manage schema with SQL migrations.

## Create the store

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { createPrismaVectorStore } from "@unrag/store/prisma";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
export const store = createPrismaVectorStore(prisma);
```

## Optional Prisma models

If you want models, pgvector is typically represented as `Unsupported("vector")` in Prisma. Many teams skip modeling embeddings and just manage them via SQL migrations and raw queries.

## Notes

- The adapter writes to `documents`, `chunks`, `embeddings` tables via SQL.
- Vector similarity uses `<=>` and sorts ascending (closest first).
