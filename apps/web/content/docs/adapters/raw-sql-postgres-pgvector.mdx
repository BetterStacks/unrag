title: Raw SQL (Postgres + pgvector)
description: The most portable adapter - pg Pool + parameterized SQL.
---

## Create the store

```ts
import { Pool } from "pg";
import { createRawSqlVectorStore } from "@unrag/store/raw-sql";

const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
export const store = createRawSqlVectorStore(pool);
```

## Notes

- This adapter is a good default when you don’t want to commit to an ORM.
- Upserts run in a transaction (begin/commit/rollback).
- Query uses `<=> $1::vector` and `limit $2`.
