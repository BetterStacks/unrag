## Planned index

- “It returns irrelevant chunks” → chunking too large, poor filtering, missing reranking
- “It misses the obvious doc” → chunking boundaries, hybrid retrieval, query rewriting
- “It leaks data across tenants” → post-filtering, missing ACL boundary, prompt-only permissions
- “It hallucinates when it shouldn’t” → no-good-match detection, grounding prompt, verification
