title: Appendix
description: Reference material - glossary, checklists, and a failure-mode index.
---

This appendix collects reference material you'll want to look up quickly: definitions, checklists, and troubleshooting guides. Unlike the main modules, these pages are designed for quick lookup rather than linear reading.

The **glossary** defines the terminology used throughout the handbook. When you encounter a term you're not sure about, check here.

The **failure modes** index is a symptom-driven troubleshooting guide. When something isn't working, look up the symptom and you'll find likely causes and what to investigate.

The **checklists** provide structured reminders for launches, security reviews, and evaluation setup. Use them as pre-flight checks before shipping.
