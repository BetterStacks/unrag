This chapter is a stub. It will become a decision guide: use case → recommended retrieval + UX patterns.
</Callout>

## Core use cases

- **Docs search** (query → ranked passages → user clicks)
- **Support copilot** (query → grounded response + citations)
- **Internal knowledge assistant** (permissions-heavy, mixed sources, high risk)
- **Codebase assistant** (structure-aware chunking, symbol-level retrieval)

## Non-goals / red flags

- “We want perfect correctness without evaluation”
- “We’ll just retrieve everything and let the model figure it out”
- “We can skip access control because it’s internal”

## Output formats and UX implications

- Snippets vs answers
- Citations and “open source” links
- “I don’t know” behavior and clarifying questions
