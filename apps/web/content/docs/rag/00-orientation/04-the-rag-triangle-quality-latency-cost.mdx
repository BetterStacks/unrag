This chapter is a stub. It will define budgets, measurement, and knobs across the pipeline.

## The triangle

- **Quality**: relevance, faithfulness, usefulness
- **Latency**: time-to-first-token and time-to-final-answer
- **Cost**: embedding, retrieval infra, reranking, generation tokens

## Where the knobs are

- Chunking (quality vs ingestion cost)
- topK + thresholds (latency vs recall)
- reranking (quality vs latency/cost)
- context packing (quality vs generation cost)

## The production move

Make tradeoffs explicit with:

- budgets (p95 latency, $ per 1k queries)
- offline evals + online monitoring
- fallbacks (degraded mode)
