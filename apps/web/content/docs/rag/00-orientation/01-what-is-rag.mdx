## The operational definition

RAG is a system pattern where you:

1. **Retrieve** relevant information from your own data
2. **Augment** the model input with that information
3. **Generate** an answer constrained by the provided context

## What RAG is not

- Not a guarantee of correctness
- Not a substitute for access control or data governance
- Not the same thing as “tools” or “agents” (though they often compose)

## Why teams choose RAG

- Freshness (keep answers aligned with current docs/data)
- Grounding (reduce hallucinations by giving the model evidence)
- Control (audit, cite sources, enforce permissions)

## Common failure modes (preview)

- Retrieval misses the right source (false negatives)
- Retrieval returns plausible-but-wrong sources (false positives)
- The model ignores the context or gets prompt-injected by it

## Optional: how this maps to Unrag

If you’re using Unrag, the “retrieval” step corresponds to `retrieve()` and the “augmentation” is whatever context formatting you implement. See `/docs/concepts/architecture` and `/docs/guides/use-with-chat`.
