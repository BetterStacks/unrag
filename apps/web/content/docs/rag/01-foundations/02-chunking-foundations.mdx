## Planned topics

- Why you chunk (retrieval granularity, embedding quality, context packing)
- Chunk size and overlap tradeoffs
- Content structure: prose vs code vs tables vs tickets

## Common mistakes

- Chunking that breaks semantic units (lists, code blocks, table rows)
- Oversized chunks that match queries for the wrong reason
- Using overlap as a bandaid for poor boundaries

## Optional: how this maps to Unrag

Unrag’s default word-based chunker is a sensible baseline and is designed to be replaced. See `/docs/concepts/chunking`.
