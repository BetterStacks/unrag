## Planned topics

- Exact vs approximate nearest neighbor search
- What “recall” means in retrieval, and how it relates to quality
- Index choice and tuning (high level)

## Common mistakes

- Turning on ANN and assuming results are “good enough” without measurement
- Comparing scores across different index/mode settings without calibration
- Missing the “filtering + ANN” interaction

## Optional: how this maps to Unrag

If you’re using Postgres + pgvector, index choices like HNSW materially change latency and recall. See `/docs/concepts/performance`.
