## Planned topics

- Distances vs similarities and why naming is confusing
- Thresholding vs topK (and why you usually need both)
- Per-corpus and per-query-class calibration

## Common mistakes

- Hardcoding one global threshold and calling it “confidence”
- Skipping “no good match” behavior (forces hallucinations)
