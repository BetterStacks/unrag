<Callout type="warn" title="Status: Draft">
This handbook is being written in public. The structure is stable, but many chapters are stubs that outline what will be covered.
</Callout>

## Who this is for

- **Beginners** building their first RAG system and trying to understand the moving parts.
- **Teams shipping to production** who need reliability, evaluation, security, and cost control.

## How to read this book (linear-first)

This handbook has one main “spine” that starts at Module 0 and ends at Module 8. Each module has an overview page with the next steps.

If you want a faster route, use one of these reading paths:

- **Beginner track**: Module 0 → Module 4, then skim Module 6 and come back later.
- **Production track**: Module 0 → Module 1 → Module 4 → Module 7 → Module 8, with targeted dips into Module 2–6 as needed.

## About Unrag examples (optional)

When examples use Unrag, they will be clearly marked as **one concrete implementation** of the general idea. You should be able to apply the same patterns with any stack.
