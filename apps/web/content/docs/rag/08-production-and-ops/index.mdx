title: Module 8 — Production and operations
description: Ship safely - observability, latency budgets, cost controls, security, reliability, governance, and scaling.

<Callout type="warn" title="Status: Draft">
This module is a scaffold. It will evolve into the launch checklist + incident response playbook for RAG systems.
</Callout>

## What you’ll learn

- How to observe and debug retrieval + generation in production
- How to keep latency and cost within budgets
- How to defend against prompt injection via retrieved content
- How to build fallbacks and degrade safely when parts fail
