## Planned topics

- Where ingestion time and cost goes (embedding usually dominates)
- Batching and concurrency limits
- Background jobs and backpressure

## Optional: how this maps to Unrag

Unrag exposes batching/concurrency controls and returns timing breakdowns. See `/docs/concepts/performance`.
