## Planned topics

- Internal docs, tickets, wikis, code, databases, user uploads
- Freshness: how “stale answers” happen
- Ownership and governance: who can approve a source

## Common mistakes

- Ingesting everything without modeling permissions
- Treating “connected sources” as inherently trustworthy
- No plan for deletions or redactions
