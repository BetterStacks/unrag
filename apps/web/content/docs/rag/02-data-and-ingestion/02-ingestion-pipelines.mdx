## Planned topics

- Idempotent ingestion contracts (stable IDs, versioning, replace vs append)
- Batch imports vs incremental sync jobs
- Queues and retries (and what not to retry)

## Common mistakes

- Creating new IDs on every sync (duplicate knowledge)
- No backpressure (rate limits, DB saturation)
- “At least once” without de-duplication
