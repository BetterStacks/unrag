title: Module 2 — Data and ingestion
description: Where production RAG usually succeeds or fails - data sourcing, pipelines, normalization, updates, and cost.

---

<Callout type="warn" title="Status: Draft">
This module is a scaffold. It will evolve into a set of concrete ingestion patterns and operational checklists.
</Callout>

## What you’ll learn

- How to choose sources and define “what counts” as knowledge
- How to design idempotent pipelines (ingest, update, delete)
- How to manage extraction/normalization so retrieval works consistently
- How to think about cost (embedding is usually the dominant ingestion cost)
