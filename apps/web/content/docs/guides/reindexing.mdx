title: Reindexing
description: Re-ingest content safely when your model or chunking changes.

You’ll typically reindex when you change:

- embedding model
- chunking defaults
- retrieval logic / store schema

## Approach

1. Decide your unit of reindexing (by `sourceId`, by tenant, by collection)
2. Re-run ingestion for the chosen scope
3. Optionally delete old chunks/embeddings (depends on your adapter/schema strategy)

## Practical patterns

- **Immutable IDs**: keep `sourceId` stable so “re-ingest” updates the same document logical identity.
- **Versioned IDs**: use `sourceId` like `docs:v2:<slug>` when you want old and new to coexist.
- **Background jobs**: reindex in a queue/cron with progress tracking.

UnRAG adapters are intentionally straightforward; if you want a “delete by sourceId” helper, add it to your vendored store adapter.
