UnRAG provides a simple retrieval scope:

```ts
await engine.retrieve({
  query: "…",
  scope: { sourceId: "tenant:abc" },
});
```

## Pattern: encode tenant in sourceId

Use `sourceId` like:

- `tenant:<tenantId>:<docId>`
- `project:<projectId>:<path>`

Then always query within that scope.

## Pattern: extend the store adapter

If you need richer filtering (tenant + docType + time range), add it in your store adapter:

- add columns to your schema
- add `where ...` conditions in the adapter query
- expose a richer scope type in your app code

Because the adapter is vendored source, this stays fully under your control.
