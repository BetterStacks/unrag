title: PDF Extractors
description: Extract searchable text from PDF documents.
---

PDF extraction converts document files into searchable text chunks. Since PDFs can contain complex layouts, tables, images, and scanned content, extraction quality depends heavily on the method used.

## Available PDF extractors

| Extractor | How it works | Best for |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| [pdf:llm](/docs/extractors/pdf/llm) | Sends PDF to an LLM for text extraction | Complex layouts, scanned docs, mixed content |

## Choosing an extractor

Currently, Unrag provides one PDF extractor: **pdf:llm**. This sends the entire PDF to a vision-capable LLM (like Gemini) which reads and transcribes the content.

**Pros:**
- Handles complex layouts, tables, and multi-column text
- Can read scanned/image-based PDFs (OCR built into the model)
- Preserves semantic structure (headings, lists)

**Cons:**
- Requires LLM API calls (cost per page)
- Subject to model token limits
- Slower than local text extraction

## Configuration

PDF extraction is controlled via `assetProcessing.pdf.llmExtraction` in your config:

```ts
export const unragConfig = {
  assetProcessing: {
    pdf: {
      llmExtraction: {
        enabled: true,
        model: "google/gemini-2.0-flash",
        prompt: "Extract all readable text from this PDF...",
        timeoutMs: 60_000,
        maxBytes: 15 * 1024 * 1024,
        maxOutputChars: 200_000,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

See [pdf:llm](/docs/extractors/pdf/llm) for detailed configuration options.
