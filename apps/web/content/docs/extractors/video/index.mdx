title: Video Extractors
description: Make videos searchable through transcription and frame analysis.
---

Videos are rich media that combine spoken content, on-screen text, and visual information. Unrag can extract searchable content from videos through two complementary strategies:

- **Transcription**: Convert the audio track to text. This is the high-value, low-effort option for most videos.
- **Frame sampling**: Sample frames at intervals and extract text from each frame. This catches on-screen text that transcription misses.

For a product demo video, transcription captures what the presenter says. Frame sampling captures the text shown in the UI. Together, they make the video fully searchable.

## Available video extractors

| Extractor | How it works | Best for |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| [video:transcribe](/docs/extractors/video/transcribe) | Transcribes the audio track into text chunks | Talks, demos, meetings—anything with speech |
| [video:frames](/docs/extractors/video/frames) | Samples frames (via ffmpeg) and runs vision extraction | Screen recordings, slide presentations, on-screen text |

## Choosing an approach

### Start with transcription

For most videos, `video:transcribe` alone provides excellent search coverage. Speakers typically narrate what's happening on screen, so the transcript captures the essence of the content.

**Use transcription for:**
- Meeting recordings
- Webinars and talks
- Tutorial videos
- Podcast videos
- Interviews

### Add frame sampling when needed

`video:frames` is more expensive and requires `ffmpeg`, but it catches visual content that transcription misses:

**Add frame sampling for:**
- Screen recordings with minimal narration
- Slide presentations where slides contain key information
- UI demos where on-screen text is important
- Videos with significant text overlays

### Using both together

You can install both extractors. Unrag will produce chunks from each, all searchable in the same query:

```ts
extractors: [
  createVideoTranscribeExtractor(),
  createVideoFramesExtractor(),
],
```

Chunks from transcription will have `metadata.extractor: "video:transcribe"`, and frame-extracted text will have `metadata.extractor: "video:frames"`.

## Typical use cases

**Internal knowledge base**: Transcribe company all-hands, product demos, and training videos. Employees can search across months of video content to find specific discussions.

**Educational content**: Index course videos. Students search for "how to configure OAuth" and find the exact lecture segment.

**Customer support**: Transcribe support call recordings (if stored as video). Agents search past calls to find how similar issues were resolved.

**Product documentation**: For software products, transcribe tutorial videos and sample frames from screen recordings. Users search docs and video content together.

## Production considerations

Video processing is resource-intensive:

- **Transcription** can take 30+ seconds for longer videos
- **Frame sampling** requires `ffmpeg` (not available in serverless)
- **Large files** consume significant bandwidth and memory

<Callout type="warn">
For production on Vercel, run video extraction in background jobs with retries. The `video:frames` extractor specifically requires a worker environment with `ffmpeg` installed. See the [Next.js Production Recipe](/docs/guides/nextjs-production-recipe).
</Callout>

## Cost considerations

- **Transcription** is priced per minute of audio. Transcribing hours of video adds up.
- **Frame sampling** involves LLM calls per sampled frame. At 0.2 FPS, a 10-minute video produces ~120 frames.

To manage costs:
- Set `maxBytes` to skip unexpectedly large files
- Adjust `sampleFps` to balance coverage vs. cost for frame sampling
- Prioritize high-value videos for extraction
