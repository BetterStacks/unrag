## Choose a model

In `unrag.config.ts`, set:

```ts
export const unragConfig = {
  embedding: {
    model: "openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    timeoutMs: 15_000,
  },
  // ...
} as const;
```

## Consistency matters

Vectors in your database should be comparable:

- If you change models, you often need to **re-embed** existing content.
- If you change dimensions, ensure your pgvector column supports it (or use untyped `vector` and validate).

UnRAG stores `embedding_dimension` alongside each embedding row to help you detect mismatches.

## Practical guidance

- Start with a cost-effective model and validate retrieval quality.
- Re-embed in a controlled job when switching models (see [Reindexing](/docs/guides/reindexing)).
