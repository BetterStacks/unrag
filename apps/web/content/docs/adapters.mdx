description: Drizzle, Prisma, and Raw SQL
---

Unrag ships 3 store adapters (all assume Postgres + pgvector):

## Drizzle
- You can import the installed schema into your app’s Drizzle schema to avoid duplicating table definitions.

## Prisma
- Uses `prisma.$executeRaw` / `prisma.$queryRaw` for vector search.
- You can keep Prisma models minimal and manage schema with SQL migrations.

## Raw SQL
- Uses `pg` and parameterized SQL.
- Most portable option.
