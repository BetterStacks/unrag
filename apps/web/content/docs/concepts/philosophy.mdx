description: Why UnRAG vendors primitives instead of shipping a framework.
---

UnRAG’s core idea is simple: **you should own your RAG implementation**.

## Principles

- **Primitives over frameworks**: UnRAG gives you `ingest()` and `retrieve()` primitives, not a black box.
- **Drop-in + auditable**: installed code is small enough to read and modify.
- **Swap components**: embedding providers and stores are interfaces you can implement.
- **Local-first**: start in your repo, keep diffs reviewable, keep prod behavior explicit.

## When UnRAG shines

- You want a “vendored source” install: source files in your repo, not an SDK that hides complexity.
- You need Postgres anyway and want pgvector without introducing a new system.
- You want to tune chunking, embedding models, or queries without fighting a framework.
