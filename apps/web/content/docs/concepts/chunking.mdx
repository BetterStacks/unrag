description: Defaults, overrides, and custom chunkers.

Chunking determines how a document is split into chunks before embedding.

## Defaults

UnRAG ships with a simple default chunker:

- word-based splitting
- `chunkSize` (default 200 “tokens” where tokens ~= words)
- `chunkOverlap` (default 40)

You can change defaults in `unrag.config.ts`:

```ts
export const unragConfig = {
  chunking: { chunkSize: 300, chunkOverlap: 60 },
  // ...
} as const;
```

## Per-ingest override

```ts
await engine.ingest({
  sourceId: "doc-1",
  content,
  chunking: { chunkSize: 500 },
});
```

## Custom chunker

If you want sentence-based chunking, markdown-aware splitting, tokenization, etc., provide a custom `chunker` when constructing the engine (typically inside `createUnragEngine()`).
