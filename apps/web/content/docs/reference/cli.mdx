description: Complete reference for the Unrag CLI commands and their options.
---

Unrag is installed and managed through CLI commands that generate files, validate configuration, and help you maintain your installation over time. This reference covers every command and option.

## Basic usage

```bash
bunx unrag@latest init
```

Running without arguments starts an interactive prompt that asks for your preferences. For CI/CD or scripted setups, pass flags to skip the prompts.

## Adding a connector

Install a connector into an existing Unrag installation:

```bash
bunx unrag@latest add notion
```

This installs vendored connector source files under your Unrag install directory (e.g. `lib/unrag/connectors/notion`) and adds connector-specific dependencies to your project.

## Adding an extractor

Install an extractor module for processing rich media assets:

```bash
bunx unrag@latest add extractor pdf-llm
```

This installs the extractor source files under `lib/unrag/extractors/<name>` and adds any required dependencies.

## Adding a battery

Install a battery module for extended functionality like reranking:

```bash
bunx unrag@latest add battery reranker
```

This installs the battery source files under your Unrag install directory (e.g. `lib/unrag/rerank/`) and adds battery-specific dependencies. Batteries are optional modules that add capabilities beyond core ingest/retrieve—see [Batteries](/docs/batteries) for available options.

<Callout>
If you ran `unrag init --rich-media` or selected extractors during setup, they're already installed and configured. You only need `add extractor` when adding more extractors later.
</Callout>

### Available extractors

| Name | Description | Dependencies |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `pdf-text-layer` | Extract built-in PDF text layer | `pdfjs-dist` |
| `pdf-llm` | Extract text from PDFs using an LLM (Gemini by default) | `ai` |
| `pdf-ocr` | OCR PDFs by rasterizing pages (worker-only) | none (requires external binaries) |
| `image-ocr` | OCR images into searchable text | `ai` |
| `image-caption-llm` | Generate image captions via LLM | `ai` |
| `audio-transcribe` | Transcribe audio into text chunks | `ai` |
| `video-transcribe` | Transcribe video into text chunks | `ai` |
| `video-frames` | Sample video frames + extract text per frame (worker-only) | `ai` + `ffmpeg` |
| `file-text` | Decode text-ish files (txt/md/html/json/csv) | none |
| `file-docx` | Extract raw text from `.docx` | `mammoth` |
| `file-pptx` | Extract slide text from `.pptx` | `jszip` |
| `file-xlsx` | Extract sheet content from `.xlsx` | `xlsx` |

### Registering extractors manually

If you installed an extractor with `add extractor` (rather than during `init --rich-media`), you need to register it in your `unrag.config.ts`:

```ts
import { createPdfLlmExtractor } from "./lib/unrag/extractors/pdf-llm";

export const unrag = defineUnragConfig({
  // ...
  engine: {
      // ...
    extractors: [createPdfLlmExtractor()],
  },
} as const);
```

You'll also need to enable the corresponding `assetProcessing` flag. For example, `pdf-llm` requires `assetProcessing.pdf.llmExtraction.enabled: true`.

<Callout>
Without registering the extractor, assets of that type will be skipped during ingestion (with warnings emitted). This is by design—you explicitly opt into extraction capabilities.
</Callout>

## Validating your installation

The doctor command checks that your Unrag installation is correctly configured:

```bash
bunx unrag doctor
```

This runs static checks that don't require a database connection—verifying that files exist, environment variables are set, and your config is coherent. Add `--db` to also check database connectivity, schema, and indexes:

```bash
bunx unrag doctor --db
```

For a complete walkthrough of what doctor checks and how to use it in CI, see the [Validating Your Installation](/docs/guides/doctor) guide.

### Doctor setup

Generate a project-specific config file and add convenience scripts to your `package.json`:

```bash
bunx unrag doctor setup
```

This creates `.unrag/doctor.json` with your settings and adds `unrag:doctor`, `unrag:doctor:db`, and `unrag:doctor:ci` scripts. Use `--yes` to skip interactive prompts.

### Doctor flags

**`--config <path>`**

Load settings from a doctor config file instead of using defaults. This is typically generated by `doctor setup`.

```bash
bunx unrag doctor --config .unrag/doctor.json
```

**`--db`**

Run database checks in addition to static checks. Requires a valid `DATABASE_URL` (or the env var specified in your config).

```bash
bunx unrag doctor --db
```

**`--json`**

Output results as JSON for programmatic consumption. Useful in CI pipelines.

```bash
bunx unrag doctor --json
```

**`--strict`**

Treat warnings as failures. When combined with `--db`, any missing recommended indexes will cause a non-zero exit code.

```bash
bunx unrag doctor --db --strict
```

**`--schema <name>`**

Specify the PostgreSQL schema name if you're not using the default `public` schema.

```bash
bunx unrag doctor --db --schema myapp
```

**`--scope <prefix>`**

Limit dimension consistency checks to embeddings whose `source_id` starts with the given prefix. Useful when you have content from multiple embedding models.

```bash
bunx unrag doctor --db --scope "docs:"
```

**`--database-url-env <name>`**

Specify which environment variable contains your database URL. Defaults to `DATABASE_URL`.

```bash
bunx unrag doctor --db --database-url-env POSTGRES_URL
```

**`--env-file <path>`**

Load environment variables from a specific file before running checks.

```bash
bunx unrag doctor --env-file .env.production
```

## Init command flags

These flags control the behavior of `unrag init`.

**`--yes` or `-y`**

Skip interactive prompts and use defaults (or values from an existing `unrag.json` file). This is essential for automated pipelines.

```bash
bunx unrag@latest init --yes
```

**`--store <adapter>`**

Choose which database adapter to install. Options are:

- `drizzle` — Drizzle ORM with typed schema
- `prisma` — Prisma client with raw SQL queries
- `raw-sql` — Direct `pg` driver usage

```bash
bunx unrag@latest init --store drizzle
```

**`--dir <path>` or `--install-dir <path>`**

Set where the vendored module code is installed, relative to your project root. The default is `lib/unrag`.

```bash
bunx unrag@latest init --dir src/lib/unrag
```

**`--alias <base>`**

Set the TypeScript path alias prefix. The default is `@unrag`, which means you'll import from `@unrag/core`, `@unrag/config`, etc.

```bash
bunx unrag@latest init --alias @myproject/rag
```

**`--rich-media`**

Enable rich media ingestion during setup. This turns on multimodal embeddings (so images can be embedded directly) and prompts you to select which extractors to install.

```bash
bunx unrag@latest init --rich-media
```

When combined with `--yes`, the CLI uses a sensible default preset of extractors (`pdf-text-layer` and `file-text`) without prompting.

**`--no-rich-media`**

Explicitly disable rich media ingestion. This is the default when running non-interactively with `--yes`, but you can use this flag to be explicit about your intent.

```bash
bunx unrag@latest init --yes --no-rich-media
```

**`--extractors <list>`**

Specify exactly which extractors to install, as a comma-separated list. This implies `--rich-media`.

```bash
bunx unrag@latest init --yes --extractors pdf-text-layer,pdf-llm,file-text
```

Available extractor names: `pdf-text-layer`, `pdf-llm`, `pdf-ocr`, `image-ocr`, `image-caption-llm`, `audio-transcribe`, `video-transcribe`, `video-frames`, `file-text`, `file-docx`, `file-pptx`, `file-xlsx`.

**`--no-install`**

Skip automatic dependency installation. By default, the CLI runs your package manager after adding dependencies to `package.json`. Use this flag in CI pipelines or when you want to manage installs separately.

```bash
bunx unrag@latest init --yes --store drizzle --no-install
```

## Full examples

A complete non-interactive invocation with text-only setup:

```bash
bunx unrag@latest init --yes --store drizzle --dir lib/unrag --alias @unrag
```

Enable rich media with default extractors:

```bash
bunx unrag@latest init --yes --store drizzle --rich-media
```

Enable rich media with specific extractors:

```bash
bunx unrag@latest init --yes --store drizzle --extractors pdf-text-layer,pdf-llm,image-ocr
```

## Files created

After initialization, your project will contain:

**`unrag.config.ts`** — The configuration file at your project root. This is where you wire together the database client, embedding provider, and default settings. Edit this file to customize behavior.

**`lib/unrag/`** (or your chosen directory) — The vendored module code:
- `core/` — ContextEngine, ingest, retrieve, types, chunking
- `store/` — Your chosen adapter (Drizzle, Prisma, or raw SQL)
- `embedding/` — The AI SDK embedding provider

**`lib/unrag/unrag.md`** — Generated setup notes including the database schema, environment variables, and adapter-specific tips.

**`unrag.json`** — Records your installation choices. When you re-run `unrag@latest init`, it reads this file and uses your previous selections as defaults.

## Files modified

**`package.json`** — Unrag adds dependencies for your chosen adapter:
- Drizzle: `drizzle-orm`, `pg`, `@types/pg`
- Prisma: `@prisma/client`, `prisma`
- Raw SQL: `pg`, `@types/pg`
- All adapters: `ai`

If dependencies already exist, their versions are not overwritten.

**`tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`** (Next.js only) — Path aliases are added:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@unrag/*": ["./lib/unrag/*"],
      "@unrag/config": ["./unrag.config.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Overwriting existing files

If target files already exist, the CLI prompts before overwriting. In non-interactive mode (`--yes`), existing files are not overwritten—you'll need to delete them manually first if you want fresh copies.

## Re-running safely

It's safe to re-run `unrag@latest init` to update your installation. The CLI reads `unrag.json` for your previous choices and prompts only for files that would be overwritten. This lets you update vendored code when new versions are available while keeping your customizations.

A typical update workflow:

1. Run `bunx unrag@latest init`
2. Review each file the CLI wants to overwrite
3. Accept updates for files you haven't customized
4. Reject updates for files with intentional local changes

## Troubleshooting

**"Could not find a project root"** — The CLI couldn't find a `package.json`. Run from your project directory.

**"Alias should start with @"** — TypeScript path aliases conventionally start with `@`. Choose something like `@unrag` or `@myproject/rag`.

**Dependency conflicts** — If the CLI adds a dependency version that conflicts with your existing packages, manually adjust `package.json` after initialization.
