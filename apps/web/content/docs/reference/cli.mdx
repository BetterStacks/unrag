description: Complete reference for the unrag init command and its options.
---

UnRAG is installed through a single CLI command that generates all the necessary files and configuration. This reference covers every option and behavior.

## Basic usage

```bash
bunx unrag init
```

Running without arguments starts an interactive prompt that asks for your preferences. For CI/CD or scripted setups, pass flags to skip the prompts.

## Command flags

**`--yes` or `-y`**

Skip interactive prompts and use defaults (or values from an existing `unrag.json` file). This is essential for automated pipelines.

```bash
bunx unrag init --yes
```

**`--store <adapter>`**

Choose which database adapter to install. Options are:

- `drizzle` — Drizzle ORM with typed schema
- `prisma` — Prisma client with raw SQL queries
- `raw-sql` — Direct `pg` driver usage

```bash
bunx unrag init --store drizzle
```

**`--dir <path>` or `--install-dir <path>`**

Set where the vendored module code is installed, relative to your project root. The default is `lib/unrag`.

```bash
bunx unrag init --dir src/lib/unrag
```

**`--alias <base>`**

Set the TypeScript path alias prefix. The default is `@unrag`, which means you'll import from `@unrag/core`, `@unrag/config`, etc.

```bash
bunx unrag init --alias @myproject/rag
```

## Full example

A complete non-interactive invocation:

```bash
bunx unrag init --yes --store drizzle --dir lib/unrag --alias @unrag
```

## Files created

After initialization, your project will contain:

**`unrag.config.ts`** — The configuration file at your project root. This is where you wire together the database client, embedding provider, and default settings. Edit this file to customize behavior.

**`lib/unrag/`** (or your chosen directory) — The vendored module code:
- `core/` — ContextEngine, ingest, retrieve, types, chunking
- `store/` — Your chosen adapter (Drizzle, Prisma, or raw SQL)
- `embedding/` — The AI SDK embedding provider

**`lib/unrag/unrag.md`** — Generated setup notes including the database schema, environment variables, and adapter-specific tips.

**`unrag.json`** — Records your installation choices. When you re-run `unrag init`, it reads this file and uses your previous selections as defaults.

## Files modified

**`package.json`** — UnRAG adds dependencies for your chosen adapter:
- Drizzle: `drizzle-orm`, `pg`, `@types/pg`
- Prisma: `@prisma/client`, `prisma`
- Raw SQL: `pg`, `@types/pg`
- All adapters: `ai`

If dependencies already exist, their versions are not overwritten.

**`tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`** (Next.js only) — Path aliases are added:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@unrag/*": ["./lib/unrag/*"],
      "@unrag/config": ["./unrag.config.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Overwriting existing files

If target files already exist, the CLI prompts before overwriting. In non-interactive mode (`--yes`), existing files are not overwritten—you'll need to delete them manually first if you want fresh copies.

## Re-running safely

It's safe to re-run `unrag init` to update your installation. The CLI reads `unrag.json` for your previous choices and prompts only for files that would be overwritten. This lets you update vendored code when new versions are available while keeping your customizations.

A typical update workflow:

1. Run `bunx unrag init`
2. Review each file the CLI wants to overwrite
3. Accept updates for files you haven't customized
4. Reject updates for files with intentional local changes

## Troubleshooting

**"Could not find a project root"** — The CLI couldn't find a `package.json`. Run from your project directory.

**"Alias should start with @"** — TypeScript path aliases conventionally start with `@`. Choose something like `@unrag` or `@myproject/rag`.

**Dependency conflicts** — If the CLI adds a dependency version that conflicts with your existing packages, manually adjust `package.json` after initialization.
