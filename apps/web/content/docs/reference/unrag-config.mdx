title: unrag.config.ts
description: The generated config file you edit to wire DB clients and defaults.
---

`unrag.config.ts` is the single place you typically edit after installation.

## What it contains

- `unragConfig`: defaults for chunking, retrieval, embedding model/timeout
- `createUnragEngine()`: constructs embedding + store + engine
- `retrieve(query: string)`: a convenience wrapper using default `topK`

## Typical edits

- Update how you create the DB client (pool options, Prisma options, etc.)
- Update embedding model and timeouts
- Update chunking defaults (`chunkSize`, `chunkOverlap`)
- Add app-specific helpers (e.g. `retrieveForTenant(tenantId, query)`)

## Server-only

Keep this file server-only. It often imports DB drivers and reads secrets from environment variables.
