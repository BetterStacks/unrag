description: What UnRAG is, what it installs, and when to use it.
---

UnRAG is a **RAG installer**. You run one command and it vendors a small RAG module into your codebase as TypeScript source files you own.

## Why this approach?

- **Auditable**: the core primitives are small and readable.
- **Composable**: you can swap the embedding provider, store adapter, and chunker.
- **Owned by you**: you ship your app with your own `lib/unrag/**` code—no hidden runtime.

## What UnRAG installs

After `unrag init`, you’ll have:

- `unrag.config.ts` (project root): your “single place” to wire DB clients + embedding provider + defaults.
- `lib/unrag/**` (or your chosen directory): the vendored primitives:
  - `core/*` (`ContextEngine`, `ingest`, `retrieve`, types, chunking)
  - `store/*` (one adapter: Drizzle / Prisma / Raw SQL; Postgres + pgvector)
  - `embedding/*` (default: `ai` SDK embedding provider)
- `lib/unrag/unrag.md`: setup notes (schema + adapter notes), generated for your selection.

## What UnRAG is not

- A hosted vector DB
- A full “chat framework”
- A crawler / ETL suite (you bring content; UnRAG gives you primitives)

## Assumptions

- **Postgres + pgvector** for storage.
- **Server-only usage** (your DB credentials and embedding API keys stay server-side).

Next: install it and create the schema.
